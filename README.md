# The-Game-of-Hog

<img src="./hog.gif">

A playable web game of Hog. In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll of up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks ***Sow Sad*** (if any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1).
